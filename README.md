# Canadian Metaweb Working Group: first meeting

Predicting the structure of ecological networks can be useful to make better predictions of pairwise interactions. Here we predict the number of interactions between vertebrates in Canadian food webs and show how food-web stability depends on species richness.

We create 4 maps that will be presented to the first meeting of the Canadian Metaweb Working Group:

![Numbers of terrestrial vertebrate species (mammals, birds, and amphibians) in Canada. Data taken from biodiversitymapping.org.](figures/species_richness.png){#fig:L_median}

![Median predicted numbers of links between terrestrial vertebrate species in Canada (log scale). The flexible links model is used to predict the number of links from the number of species and all food webs archived on mangal.io are used for model fitting.](figures/maps_L_median.png){#fig:L_median}

![Percentile intervals (68%) of the predicted numbers of links between terrestrial vertebrate species in Canada (log scale). The flexible links model is used to predict the number of links from the number of species and all food webs archived on mangal.io are used for model fitting.](figures/maps_L_PI.png){#fig:L_PI}

![Stability scores of food webs of terrestrial vertebrate species in Canada. Higher numbers indicate a high probability that the corresponding network is stable.](figures/maps_stab.png){#fig:L_PI}
